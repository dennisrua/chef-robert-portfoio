# 👨‍🍳 Chef's Professional Culinary Portfolio

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a modern, single-page, fully responsive portfolio website designed to showcase the culinary expertise and philosophy of a professional chef.  
In the documentation, the chef is referenced as **Chef Robert R.N.**, while the implementation in the code uses **Chef Anna R.**.

The site is built with **Tailwind CSS** using a utility-first approach for clean, scalable, and maintainable styling. A refined **Charcoal and Gold** palette conveys elegance and professionalism, with smooth navigation and clear calls-to-action to engage visitors.
